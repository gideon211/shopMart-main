## 📌 About the Project

This is a simple but functional e-commerce web app built entirely with **React** and **Context API** for state management. It features product browsing, search, a working cart system, and an order flow — all built during **Day 57 of my #100DaysOfCode challenge**.

> Special thanks to my teaching fellow **Joshua Doe**, who helped guide the development of:
> - 🛒 The add-to-cart logic  
> - 🔍 The search functionality using context  
> - 🧾 The order placement system
